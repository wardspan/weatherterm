# weatherterm

A web scraping application that will scrape weather forecast information from https://weather (dot) com and present it in a terminal.

Other options will include:

* The temperature unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit)
* The area where you can get the weather forecast
* Output options where the user can choose between the current forecast, a five-day forecast, a ten-day forecast, and the weekend
* Ways to complement the output with extra information such as wind and humidity

This application will be designed to be extendable, allowing parsers for different websites to get a weather forecast, and these parsers will be available as argument options.
